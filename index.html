    <h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
    <p>My name is Lydia Hunt (she/hers). </p>
    <h2>My goals for this course:</h2>
    <p> I know very little about coding, and I'd love to get a better handle of it!
      I would also like to get a little quicker at doing coding work. </p>
    <h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
    <p>I'm a senior, a business major, with an emphasis in marketing, and a CTD minor.
      I love to spend time with my friends and family, travel, hike, swim, take photos and go on new adventures!</p>
