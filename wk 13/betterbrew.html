    <h2 > ABOUT </h2>
    <p> Better Brew is a project I completed for a text-based design class at The University of Colorado. Below are the steps I followed through the process of this project, in which I conceptualized and created a design for canned coffee. In the design process of the project I utilized Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and XD. I created all the icons in this project on Illustrator, I found inspiration and moodboard photos on Pinterest, and ultimately used Powerpoint to present the design and my design process.</p>
